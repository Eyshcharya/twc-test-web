# twc-test-web
This is the Front-end of the Application which has been build up using Vite.
 - React.js has been used to build the UI components.
 - Plain CSS has been used to style React components.
   
## Note
At the time when I was building the front-end, I did not have experience on Tailwind CSS. Currently I am doing practise projects with Tailwind CSS.

At the time I was building the front-end, the folder structure I have used is not something I'd be satisfied today. I have evolved from that to here. ![image](https://github.com/Eyshcharya/twc-test-web/assets/132150734/5b2541e4-81ec-4408-8a4d-a1df1fbdc1bf)
